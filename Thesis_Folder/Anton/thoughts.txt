Attempt 1:
muscle activation is smooth with just bws but choppy with torque actor applied. 
Also noticed that there was no impaired bws model so the torque actor essentially had nothing to assit with

- developed impaired bws model (metadata_bws_crip_knee_hip.txt)

Attempt 2:
Same as attempt 1 but with the impaired bws model
muscled activations appear even more choppy, torque actor also appears to be overcompensating (leg swinging wildly)
possible Issues: skeleton legs are not resisted by exoskeleton structure, this might be causing the torque actor to 
overcompensate the leg to swing around into a position with a high reward. muscles nn is more than likely actively 
resisting the torque actor.

- constrain legs
- rerun sim

unable to rerun sim
- successfully developed and tested running from checkpoint

Attempt 3:
Constrain legs to planar motion, rerun sim
- constraining legs worked but torque actor is still too sporatic

Attempt 4:
keep legs constrained, add torque magnitude parameter to reward function
- performance was even worse
- updated code to return maximum checkpoints for future analysis

Attempt 5:
Updating reward function to only deal with trajectories and torque smoothness
- something seems wrong with the torque smoothness paparmeter
- going to investigate torque smoothness parameter to find faults. 

attempt 6:
- applied torque is much smoother than previous iterations but there is clearly a lot of room for improvement.
