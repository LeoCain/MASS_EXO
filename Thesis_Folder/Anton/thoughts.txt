Attempt 1:
muscle activation is smooth with just bws but choppy with torque actor applied. 
Also noticed that there was no impaired bws model so the torque actor essentially had nothing to assit with

- developed impaired bws model (metadata_bws_crip_knee_hip.txt)

Attempt 2:
Same as attempt 1 but with the impaired bws model
muscled activations appear even more choppy, torque actor also appears to be overcompensating (leg swinging wildly)
possible Issues: skeleton legs are not resisted by exoskeleton structure, this might be causing the torque actor to 
overcompensate the leg to swing around into a position with a high reward. muscles nn is more than likely actively 
resisting the torque actor.

- constrain legs
- rerun sim
