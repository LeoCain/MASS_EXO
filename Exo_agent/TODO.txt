1. optimise exo_agent (currently makes the gait worse).
    a) reward function
    b) optimiser (try adam/different learning rates)
    c) number of epochs
    d) neural net architechture
    e) adjust frequency of torque application?
    f) change c++ step to call python step?
    g) multiple workers?
2. Train benjaSIM with f0 parameter set to 0, to see the effect.
3. Train benjaSIM with only r_ee and r_v/only r_ee/r_ee - net activation energy used.
3. record different muscle group activations
    a) knee flexion muscle group
    b) knee extensor muscle group
    c) hip flexion muscle group
    d) hip extensor muscle group
4. record torque applied at each joint
    a) Left hip
    b) Left knee
    c) Right hip
    d) Right knee
5. record joint angles
    a) Left hip
    b) Left knee
    c) Right hip
    d) Right knee
6. record reward during training
    a) lower bound
    b) upper bound
    c) mean
7. live graph recorded values
    a) muscle group activations 
    b) applied torques
    c) joint angles
    d) reward with bounds
