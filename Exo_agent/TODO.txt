1. optimise exo_agent (currently makes the gait worse).
    a) reward function
    b) optimiser (try adam/different learning rates)    - using tune
    c) number of epochs
    d) neural net architechture
    e) adjust frequency of torque application?
    f) change c++ step to call python step?
    g) multiple workers?
    h) play around with ray.tune()
    i) torch vs tf                              - Minimal difference - use torch/whichever can solve memeory leak
    j) 'horizon' config issue
    k) memory leak error
    l) batch size
-   quantify difference between ref and actual
3. Train benjaSIM with only r_ee and r_v/only r_ee/r_ee - net activation energy used.
11. train a normal version of benjaSIM for reference, record all its plots
12. decide on a crippled model of benjaSIM
13: use ray.tune to find optimal training batch size, lr, momentum 
    - use scheduler (PBT/PB2?)
    - should log and graph the results of each trial
    - would be good if can save the weights of the best one
    - WRITTEN BUT NEED TO CHECK FUNCTIONALITY -how many tune samples/stop case
14: change reward so it doesn't corss over 0 - shoots to large positive or converges to 0   - CONVERGES TO 0
9. visually show torque application



-   End render sim after certain number of seconds - DONE
2. Train benjaSIM with f0 parameter set to 0, to see the effect. - DONE
    - visually removed the muscles, but benjaSIM still able to walk and flex knee
      albeit with a limp.
3. record different muscle group activations    - DONE
    a) knee flexion muscle group                - DONE

    d) hip extensor muscle group                - DONE
4. record torque applied at each joint  - DONE
    a) Left hip                         - DONE
    b) Left knee                        - DONE
    c) Right hip                        - DONE
    d) Right knee                       - DONE
5. record joint angles                  - DONE
    a) Left hip                         - DONE
    b) Left knee                        - DONE
    c) Right hip                        - DONE
    d) Right knee                       - DONE
6. record reward during training    - DONE
    a) lower bound                  - DONE
    b) upper bound                  - DONE
    c) mean                         - DONE
7. live graph recorded values - for exo env
    a) muscle group activations     - DONE
    b) applied torques              - DONE
    c) joint angles                 - DONE
    d) reward with bounds           - DONE
    e) joint angles actual vs desired   - DONE
